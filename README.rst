WARNING
-------
This is software is alpha state. Tested only on EUR version of IR-R6, but
should support other versions as well.

Cloning from and to device seems to be quite safe operation. In my test
sending broken data to radio cause at least memory reset.

But I not responsible if someone damage/brick own device using this software.
Using at on own risk.
