Icom IC-R6 Manager  [WIP]
=========================


Simple TK application for manage Icom IC-R6 scanner memory.

Features:
- load and save ifc file
- clone data from and to radio
- edit channels, banks, scan links / edges
- display autowrite channels
- change settings


WARNING
-------
This is software i alfa state. Tested only on EUR version of IR-R6.

Cloning from and to device seems to be quite safe operation. In my test
sending broken data to radio cause at least memory reset.

But I not responsible if someone damage/brick own device using this software.
Using at on own risk.


Requirements
-------------
- Python 3.11+
- Tkinter
- pyserial
